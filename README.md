# Simple_Bank_Application_v1.0
Here I made a simple bank application in C language. This is my first ever project that I made for practical proof for ausbildung.
## How it works?  
It works on simple C language using for and while loops, string functions, file handling funtions, if, if-else and if-else-if and standard i/o functions.
## Installation in Windows:  
No need for anything, just make sure ANSI support is available for your windows terminal and that's it.  
## Enabling support for ANSI in Older Windows:  
You can try installing ANSICON that enables support for ANSI escape sequences written inside the code. So yeah, if you install ANSICON on your computer, the ANSI sequences written in the code will work.
