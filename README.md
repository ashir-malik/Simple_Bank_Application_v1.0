# Simple_Bank_Application_v1.0
Here I made a simple bank application in C language. This is my first ever project that I made for practical proof for ausbildung.
## How it works?  
It works on simple C language using for and while loops, string functions, file handling funtions, if, if-else and if-else-if and standard i/o functions.
## Installation in Windows:  
No need for anything, just make sure ANSI support is available for your windows terminal and that's it. 
## Installation on Linux/Ubuntu:  
Type in the following commands:
<pre>sudo apt update  
sudo apt install build-essential -y  
git clone </pre>
